/// Estimate the number of primes smaller than x using the asymptotic expansion of Li(x) with 4 terms, i.e.:
///
///   `ùúã(ùë•) ~ x/ln x * (1 + 1!/ln x + 2!/ln^2 x + 3!/ln^3 x).`
///
/// # Error considerations
///
/// There are two components to the error:
///
/// 1. The truncation error from using a limited number of terms (4) of the asymptotic expansion of Li(x): `|Li(x) -
///    Li_approx(x)|`
/// 2. The theoretical error, given by the absolute difference between œÄ(x) and Li(x): `|œÄ(x) - Li(x)|`
///
/// ## Truncation Error
///
/// The size of the truncation error for the 4-term approximation `Li_approx(x)` is roughly the size of the first
/// omitted term, which is `24x / (ln x)^5`.
///
/// | Bits | Truncation error (abs)     | Truncation error (rel) |
/// | :--- | :------------------------- | :----------------------|
/// | 1024 | ~2^981                     | ~2^-33                 |
/// | 2048 | ~2^2000                    | ~2^-37                 |
/// | 4096 | ~2^4043                    | ~2^-41                 |
///
/// *(Relative error is calculated as the first omitted term divided by / Li_approx(x)`)*
///
/// ## Theoretical Error
///
/// Assuming RH, we can use Schoenfeld‚Äôs bound `|œÄ(x) - Li(x)| < (1 / 8œÄ) * ‚àöx * ln x`. This gives a very small
/// theoretical error bound compared to the best known unconditional bounds (by Trudgian).
///
/// | Bits | Error Bound (abs) | Error Bound (rel) 		|
/// | :--- | :---------------- | :--------------------- |
/// | 1024 | < 2^517           | < 2^-497               |
/// | 2048 | < 2^1030          | < 2^-1007              |
/// | 4096 | < 2^2055          | < 2^-2029              |
///
/// *(Relative error bound is calculated as `Schoenfeld‚Äôs Bound (abs) / Li_approx(x)`)*
///
/// ## Discussion
/// Assuming RH, the dominant error term in estimating `œÄ(x)` with `Li_approx(x)` comes from truncating the asymptotic
/// expansion of Li(x). While this truncation error is extremely small in relative terms, it is large in absolute terms.
/// Improving the Li(x) approximation to be the same order of magnitude as the Schoenfeld bound would require using
/// hundreds of terms from the asymptotic series (or employing more complex methods like continued fractions for the
/// remainder, which is beyond the scope of this simple approximation). In relative terms the relative error bound is
/// approximately ~2^-33 (for 1024 bits) down to ~2^-41 (for 4096 bits). This corresponds to an extremely small
/// percentage error (significantly less than 10^-8 %).
///
/// It should be noted that while Li(x) is generally smaller than œÄ(x) for 'small' x, it is known that the sign of `œÄ(x)
/// - Li(x)` changes infinitely often. It has been proven that there must be a crossing below ~10^316 (~2^1051), which
/// is well within the ranges used in this library. Thus, users should be aware that the estimate provided here can be
/// both greater than and smaller than the actual value of œÄ(x).
